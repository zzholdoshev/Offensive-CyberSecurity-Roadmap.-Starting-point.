> [!CbS roadmap]
>   Series of Cybersecurity roadmaps for those who want to learn offensive security. The roadmaps are intended to be viewed in Obsidian. "Starting point" roadmap is intended primarily as starting point for pentest, contains most important things to help you get started with CTF. Only **Free** labs are included in all roadmaps. Combined with intermediate and advanced roadmaps, it can build a solid foundation for offensive security and help you land a job in CbS. OSINT and stegano are not included in this roadmap - these topics can be explored within the challenges on platforms from [[🧭 CyberSecurity roadmap. Starting point#^8af021|links]])

# Suggested Order ([[CbS Roadmap Visualization.canvas|visualization]]): 

1.  Starting point. Go through this roadmap from top to bottom #basic_cbs #web_I #linux_I #networks_I #CTF #forensics #C #SQL #python #git #gdb 
2. [[🏴Cbs intermediate roadmap|intermediate roadmap]]  #web_II #infra #linux_II #docker #AD #windows #privesc_I #networks_II
	*  [[☁️cloud CbS roadmap|cloud CbS roadmap]] (**optional**) - a cloud-oriented roadmap for cloud-oriented junior/intern appsec position if you can get one at this level. Otherwise skip this step. #cloud #kubernetes
3. Advanced roadmap. Solid college-level foundation for CbS on topics like #reverse #binary #system_security #low_level #kernel #sandboxing #privesc_II #programming #code_security #malware^114cf4
	 * [ ] [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/dojos) -  free comprehensive college-level courses from Arizona State University. Recommended to do every module. Linux Luminarium, access control, privEsc, data encoding and crypto are included in the first 2 roadmaps.
	* Review this [roadmap](https://github.com/hoppersroppers/roadmap/blob/master/README.md). It is partly integrated in this roadmap.

# Core - C, SQL, computer networks and crypto

> [!about Ecole42 / school21]
> In this module School 21 / Ecole42 projects (School 21 is a Russian version of Ecole42) are suggested. You can drop this part if you are not a school 21 / Ecole42 and use alternative path. The most important thing about School 21 /  Ecole 42 is that it is a programming school, learning how to code is extremely helpful for CbS.
> Starting from 10th project in School 21, the most fundamental topics are completed and specialization is started. This projects are focused on CbS engineering rather than offensive security so I decided to make them optional though some of the concepts are relevant and helpful (especially 12th and 13 projects)

## Core CbS Ecole42 / School 21 projects:
### School 21 / Ecole42 C bootcamp #C #coding #memory_management #git #gdb
>Learn coding, memory and low-level concepts. Very good foundation for CbS specialist and preparation for the third [[🧭 CyberSecurity roadmap. Starting point#^114cf4|roadmap]] in the future
- [x] C bootcamp 
### School 21 / Ecole42 sql bootcamp #SQL
- [x] SQL bootcamp 
### School 21 / Ecole42 devops projects
- [x] the first basic devops projects 

>  On topics like linux, network and docker. Don't go too deep into pure devops projects
### School 21 CbS projects
#### School 21 CbS 1-4 projects #networks_I #gns3 #wireshark
* [x] s21_1 ✅ 
* [x] s21_2 ✅

* [ ] s21_16 - project lifecycle
* [ ] s21_17 - physical security
* [ ] s21_18 - social engineering and #OSINT
### Ecole42 CbS projects
* [ ] Review and complete the most important CbS projects in Ecole42, especially on topics like networks, crypto, linux. Don't go too deep - start doing CTFs and other parts of this roadmap ASAP
## Alternative for core CbS Ecole42 / School 21:
### Intro to computer science
* [ ] [CS50](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T380hlTqAU8HfvVepCcjCqTg6&si=6fRP30JMlcproLeo) (optional) - legendary Stanford introduction to computer science. Gives you basic understanding of C and coding, memory, algorithms, data structures and how computer works. You can drop AI part. This course includes not only lectures abut also [problem set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) Updated every year. If pacing seems a bit slow - skip this part.
* [ ] Great fundamental [course](https://www.roppers.org/courses/technical-security-fundamentals) about technical security 

### Tools
#### #vim (optional but HIGHLY recommended) 
- [ ] learn vim and configure neovim:
	Just install vim and type in terminal `vimtutor`. Follow the instructions. Then download vim cheatsheet and try write everything in vim, checking with cheatsheet. Then configure neovim with plugins such as auto complete and themes.
> OR 
- [ ] install and learn emacs 
#### #Git:
fun git games for learning git. Try to learn git by doing, don't waste your time on "studying" git
- [ ] https://gitmastery.me/intro/
- [ ] https://learngitbranching.js.org
#### virtualization and containerization:
 - [ ] learn basic virtualization and containerization (docker)
 > just read articles, watch youtube lectures, then deploy VMs in KVM/Virtualbox. Run some docker containers - learn about isolation, basic docker networking
### #C :
- [ ] Learn [basic Syntax](https://www.learn-c.org)
- [ ] C/C++: great russian-language [course](https://stepik.org/course/193691/syllabus)
- [ ] github roadmap [learn C in 60 days](https://github.com/Sckab/C-RoadMap/tree/master) ^a97ce8
> OR find, review and complete other courses that cover basic C programming.
- [ ] learn how to use valgrind and gdb
> After that just work on a couple of pet projects. Recommendation: write a shell/malloc/something else from this [repo](https://github.com/hoppersroppers/roadmap/blob/master/training/c.md) or/and some C game from this [repo](https://github.com/Xtremilicious/projectlearn-project-based-learning). **Use Valgrind to check for memory leaks**, push code to github/gitlab and use clang-format. This will teach you how to think like a programmer as well as some low-level concepts. This is also a preparation for the third [[🧭 CyberSecurity roadmap. Starting point#^114cf4|roadmap]] 


### #sql:
- [ ]  [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/fundamentals/sql-playground/) + this [course](https://sqlbolt.com) + and [this](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)(for reference) **OR / AND:** RU free sql [course](https://sql-academy.org/ru)

### #crypto:
- [ ] [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/intro-to-cybersecurity/cryptography/) -crypto module on pwn.college
> OR / AND:
- [ ] [cryptohack](https://cryptohack.org/challenges/) additional course on crypto
- [ ] https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography - additional course on crypto from khan academy, helpful and illustrative but not that deep (**optional**)

### #networks :
- [ ] https://www.roppers.org/courses/networking  - very practical course 
	> optional:
- [ ] https://www.professormesser.com/netplus-resources/
	> OR / AND: 
- [ ] [computer networks - top down approach by J. Kurose](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/online_lectures.htm) - a great introductory course with interactive labs. There is also a book by this author.
	
* Additional courses:
	* Russian-lang courses: [A. Sozykin](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtPJ9lKvJ4oiNMvYbOzCmWy6cRzYAh9B1)
	* more advanced networking courses and network security in [[🏴Cbs intermediate roadmap#^9ad11f]]. You don't need CCNA at this point, but you need to know basics - you can try CISCO courses in that roadmap or CCNA if you are **really** interested in networks.

[^1]: this languages were chosen because: C/C++ are very fundamental in terms of CS in general, knowing C helps in reverse engineering and binary exploitation, C++ is used for creating malware and most desktop apps, as well as apps for critical infrastructure and embedded. Rust is memory-safe and will replace C/C++ in most critical infrastructure, go is efficient for backend and has some interesting concepts. You can choose other languages, for example if you are interested in mobile - java/kotlin/swift. Python is not included because it is a default scripting language for pentest, you should know it at this point. JS is not included because you should learn it by doing WEB pentesting at basic level - going too deep in frontend is pointless. PHP is not included because it is becoming legacy, just learn php vulnerabilities.
