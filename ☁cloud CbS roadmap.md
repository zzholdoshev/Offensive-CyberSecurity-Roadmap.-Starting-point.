## A Comprehensive Hardening and Risk Mitigation Strategy for Cloud and Container Infrastructures: A Practical Guide and Roadmap (2025-2026)

> Modern information systems architecture has shifted to distributed microservice environments managed via Kubernetes in the cloud. This has expanded the attack surface, requiring hardening systems at all levels—from the Linux kernel to cloud IAM. This report presents protection mechanisms and a structured roadmap for learning.

## Chapter 1: Fundamental Hardening of the Linux Operating System

Cloud security starts with the Linux OS. Hardening is the process of reducing the attack surface through software minimization and strict permissions.

### 1.1. Rwx Permissions and ACLs

The rwx (read, write, execute) bit system is the foundation of security. Errors in directory permissions often lead to data compromise. For security, the principle of least privilege and the use of the Sticky Bit (for example, in /tmp) are recommended, ensuring that only the owner can delete files. ACLs allow granular access control for specific users.

### 1.2. sudo Security

Incorrect configuration in /etc/sudoers is a critical risk. Vulnerabilities like CVE-2019-14287 demonstrate that errors in UID handling can bypass restrictions. Modern hardening includes disabling ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL, using requirety, and mandatory call auditing.

## Chapter 2: Container Isolation and Kernel Primitives

Containers use the host kernel, so isolation mechanisms are critical to preventing container escapes.

- **Namespaces:** Virtualize resources (PID, NET, MNT, USER), creating the illusion of an isolated system.

- **Cgroups:** Limit resource consumption (CPU, memory, PIDs), preventing DoS attacks such as "fork bombs."

- **Seccomp and Capabilities:** Seccomp filters kernel system calls, while Capabilities fragment root privileges, allowing only the necessary ones (e.g., CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE).

## Chapter 3: Advanced Sandboxes: gVisor and MicroVM

Standard containers are not sufficient for running untrusted code (e.g., AI agents).

- **gVisor:** Intercepts user-space system calls, allowing only about 20 safe calls to the host kernel.

- **MicroVM (Kata, Firecracker):** Runs each container in a separate, lightweight virtual machine with its own kernel, providing hardware isolation.

## Chapter 4: Kubernetes Security and Operations

Kubernetes requires protection for the Control Plane, etcd, and workloads.

- **Network Policies:** By default, all pods in K8s can see each other. The Zero Trust model requires the implementation of `Network Policies` to limit traffic.

- **RBAC and Admission Control:** Errors in service account permissions are a common cause of hacks. Tools like `Kyverno` or `OPA` block the creation of insecure resources.

## Chapter 5: Kubernetes in Cloud Environments (EKS, GKE, AKS)

Working in the cloud shifts the focus to integrating K8s with the provider's infrastructure.

- **Cloud IAM:** In the cloud, identity is the new perimeter. Using `Workload Identity` allows pods to access cloud resources (S3, BigQuery) without static keys.

- **Network Integration:** Cloud K8s uses native VPCs and load balancers. It is important to configure `Private Google Access` or `AWS PrivateLink` to isolate traffic within the cloud.

- **Specific Threats:** Attacks through the metadata service (IMDSv2) in AWS can lead to theft of node roles.
